This paper presents CityHood, an innovative travel recommendation system that leverages explainable AI to provide personalized city and neighborhood recommendations. The system combines machine learning techniques with user preferences to suggest optimal travel destinations while providing clear explanations for each recommendation.

## Abstract

Travel recommendation systems have become increasingly important in the digital age, yet many existing solutions lack transparency in their decision-making processes. CityHood addresses this gap by implementing an explainable AI framework that not only provides accurate recommendations but also explains the reasoning behind each suggestion.

## Key Contributions

- Novel explainable recommendation algorithm
- Comprehensive dataset of city and neighborhood features
- User study demonstrating improved satisfaction with explainable recommendations
- Open-source implementation available for research community

## Methodology

Our approach combines collaborative filtering with content-based recommendations, enhanced with explainability features that highlight the most important factors influencing each recommendation.
