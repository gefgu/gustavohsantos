# Hello and welcome to my blog!

This is a space where I’ll share my journey as a young researcher navigating the world of top-tier academic research and international conferences.

Pursuing research at a high level is both exciting and challenging. It's a path filled with uncertainty, but also one that can be incredibly rewarding. At just 20 years old, I’ve had the unique opportunity to participate in international conferences and engage with global research communities — something I never imagined would happen so early in my career.

One of the hardest parts has been not knowing anyone else with similar experiences at this stage. Without clear examples to follow, it’s difficult to know what to expect or how to prepare. That’s why I’ve decided to share my experiences — to offer insights, encouragement, and inspiration to those who might be just a few steps behind me.

If you're a student curious about research, or simply unsure of how to start, I hope this blog helps you find your way.
