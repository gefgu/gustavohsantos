This portfolio website showcases my academic work, research projects, and personal thoughts through a clean, professional interface. Built with modern web technologies, it demonstrates my skills in both frontend development and content management.

## Features

- **Fast Performance**: Built with Astro for optimal loading speeds
- **SEO Optimized**: Proper meta tags and structured data for search engines
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Automated deployment pipeline

## Technical Implementation

The website uses Astro's content collections feature to manage different types of content:

- **Publications**: Academic papers with metadata like venue, authors, and links
- **Projects**: Technical projects with descriptions, tags, and demo links
- **Blog**: Personal thoughts, conference experiences, and research insights

## Development Process

1. **Planning**: Designed the information architecture and user experience
2. **Setup**: Configured Astro with TypeScript and content collections
3. **Development**: Built reusable components and page layouts
4. **Content**: Created structured markdown templates for easy content management
5. **Deployment**: Set up automated GitHub Actions workflow

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was organizing the content structure to be both flexible and maintainable. The solution was to use Astro's content collections with TypeScript schemas to ensure data consistency while allowing for easy updates.
